Connor Stitt is a first-year graduate student in the Penn State Political Science department studying American Politics and Social Data Analytics. His research builds on his undergraduate work with public
opinion data investigating support for Islamophobic political violence. More recently, his interests include applying
network methodology to study collaboration among financiers in the Chinese development finance sector. </p>
            <p>
            He recently graduated from NC State University with a B.S. in Political Science and minors in Mathematics and Statistics. Connor previously worked as a part-time SAT, Calculus, and Statistics tutor at Sylvan Learning and as an undergraduate research assistant with Dr. Jessica Liao for her work on Chinese clean energy investments in ASEAN countries.          </p>

        <h3>American Politics Research</h3>
          <p>His research follows two paths. Firstly, his research builds on his independent undergraduate work with public opinion data investigating support for Islamophobic political violence in the United States. He is interested in uncovering the individual-level determinants for the support of intergroup violence, particularly through the lens of ingroup-outgroup dynamics.</p>
        <h3>Chinese Development Finance Research</h3>
          </p>Secondly, his work focuses on applying network methodology to analyze collaboration among financiers in the Chinese development finance sector. At a broader level, he is interested in understanding whether the US-China trade war has had any substantive effect on international economic interdependence. Specifically, he investigates the conditions under which institutions cofinance syndicated loans and identifies the sectors in which these partnerships emerge. By mapping cofinancing patterns, his work trace China's commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals of the Belt and Road Initiative and the countries with which Chinese banks prefer to collaborate. He is interested in advancing network methodology to model these multi-layered, high-dimensional financial relationships.</p>
